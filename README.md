## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **GitHub Actions** triggers every day at midnight IST (18:30 UTC)
2. Scrapes **Amazon Music** for top 100 trending songs → `data/data.json`
3. Scrapes **MusicBrainz** for ~6000 Indian artist names → `data/indian_artists.json`
4. Scrapes **kworb.net** for all 2000 artists + their iTunes Today scores
5. **Fuzzy-matches** Indian artists against kworb list, ranks by Today score → `data/Top_Indian_Artist.json`
6. Fetches **artist images** from iTunes Search API (free, no key needed)
7. Auto-commits and pushes updated data → GitHub Pages serves fresh site

## 🚀 Setup (one-time)
